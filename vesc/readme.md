## What is VESC? <a name="vesc"></a>

VESC stands for Vedder Electronic Speed Controller, which is a type of electronic speed controller (ESC) commonly used in electric vehicles, electric skateboards, and other electric motor applications.

## Software <a name="software"></a>

You can find the VESC software in the repositories (path: [VESC_tool_6.02](https://github.com/JordanLaw/robocon/tree/9d138ca345b671d4a66e2e8c82a524e70ce1fe27/vesc)). Or you can download VESC Tool from [VESC Project Website](https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool) (You need to create an account)

## Setting-up <a name="set"></a>

It is an example of a connection with VESC and motor.

<img src="photo/setting_up.png" width="1200"><br><br>
<img src="photo/setting_up2.JPEG" width="600"><br><br>

## Getting start <a name="start"></a>

### Calibration: Wizards for setting up motor FOC <a name="calibration"></a>

Click the ‚ÄúWelcome & Wizards‚Äù button and the ‚ÄúSetup Motors FOC‚Äù button

<img src="photo/01.png" width="1200"><br><br>

At the beginning, it will ask you to restore the motor drive into default setting, please choose ‚ÄúNO‚Äù if you have already calibrated the motor drive before. If you click ‚ÄúYES‚Äù, you will need to configure all the Motor Setting and App Setting again.

<img src="photo/02.png" width="600"><br><br>

You can choose the usage type of your motor depend on how will you run your motor. this time we will choose ‚ÄúGeneric‚Äù.

<img src="photo/03.png" width="800"><br><br>

Then, you need to choose the size or type of your motor. Usually, we are using ‚ÄúSmall Outrunner (~200 g)‚Äù, it depends on what kind of motor you are using. 

<img src="photo/04.png" width="800"><br><br>

Warning will pop up to remind you if the type of the motor is wrong, the motor will be destroyed. So, make sure the type of the motor is correct before you click ‚ÄúYES‚Äù.

<img src="photo/05.png" width="800"><br><br>

Next, you need to choose the right parameter which fix to your battery. If depends on what kind of battery you are using.

<img src="photo/06.png" width="800"><br><br>

Below figures are example, it show how to know the number of cells series.

1. Check the label on the packet. "P" part means Parallel. The "S" part means "Series". "6S1P" means 6 cells in serises, 1 parallel. Therefore, we should type 6 in the box.

!!!!!! Warning !!!!!!<br>
Don't mxied up the "Series" and "Parallel", you should type the number of "Series".<br>
Otherwise it may damage the vesc, motor and battery
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<img src="photo/battery_1.jpeg" width="800"><br><br>

2. Count number of the packet number.

<img src="photo/battery_2.jpeg" width="800"><br><br>

So in this case, you need to choose "BATTERY_TYPE_LIION_3.0__4.2" as Battery Type, type "6" in the Battery Cells Series and type 3.2 in the Battery Capacity. After that, you can click "Next" and go to net step.

Warning will pop up to remind you if the type of the battery is wrong, the battery will be destroyed. So, make sure the type of the battery is correct before you click ‚ÄúYES‚Äù.

<img src="photo/07.png" width="800"><br><br>

Next, For the Gear ratio and the Wheel Diameter, it is just for the log analysis (not sure). If you are not using the data provided from the VESC, you can click Direct Drive and use the default Wheel Diameter.

For the Motor Poles, please refer what kind of motor you are using, there should be a number of motor poles shown on that motor datasheet. (example: M3058 motor has 14 poles)

After you fill up all the parameter, you can start the detection by clicking the ‚ÄúRUN DETECTION‚Äù and it will start to calibrate the motor. Then you need to wait until the calibration process finished.

<img src="photo/08.png" width="800"><br><br>

A window will pop up and show you all the motor status after the completion of the calibration, you can still change the value if you are not happy with that in the "FOC" tab.

<img src="photo/13.png" width="800"><br><br>

### Test the calibration or run the motor with VESC <a name="test"></a>

Now, you can test the calibration of the motor is well or not. To control the motor using VESC, you need to enbale keyboard control by clicking the tab on the right hand side. Also, you can review the realtime data by clicking the tab below the keyboard control tab. After you enable the keyboard, you can use Arrow keys to control the motor spin.

Up and Down arrow key -> current control<br>
Right and Left arrow key -> duty control<br>

<img src="photo/enable_1.png" width="800"><br><br>

Also, you can use the command platform at the bottom of the VESC app.
1. Duty control - control the speed of the motor based on the percentage of voltage you set
2. Current control - control the speed of the motor based on the current you set
3. RPM control - control the speed of the motor based on the RPM you set, it need to adjust the PID parameter in order t have a well performance
4. Postion control - turn the motor directon into required angle, need to adjust the PID parameter as RPM control
5. Full break
6. Switch off

<img src="photo/vesc_control.png" width="1200"><br><br>

if you want to review the realtime status of your motor, you can click the "Realtime Data" tab on the left hand side in the app. There are few things you can review, Current put into the motor, the temperature of VESC, RPM of your motor, the position of your motor (if you have encoder).

<img src="photo/enable_2.png" width="1500"><br><br>

### Sensorless motor setting up <a name="sensorless"></a>

In case, you don't have a encoder for your motor, you can configure your motor from "Sensorless" tab in the "FOC". However, you still need to calibrate your motor first before you configure the data in this tab.

Normally, you need to change a higher "Openloop ERPM" in order to start the motor in the senorless mode. (example: 12,000). You can change the value depand on the type of your motor.
Also, you can set a longer time for the "Openloop Ramp Time" which can avoid lagging at the beginning.

<img src="photo/09.png" width="800"><br><br>


## Motor Setting <a name="motorsettng"></a>

### Motor Detection <a name="motordetect"></a>

if the direction of your wheel is not correct, you can revert the direction of the motor in this tab. (True or False)

<img src="photo/11.png" width="800"><br><br>

### Current <a name="current"></a>

You can limit the max current of the motor driver put in order to avoid overcurrent. if you have already done the wizards of the setting-up motor FOC, you may not need to change this value because it have already calculate the max current of the motor can afford. However, you can still set a lower maximum current in this tab.

Also, there is a value called Absolute Maximum Current which means that if the current over this value, it will stop the motor immediately and print a fault message in the VESC terminal.

<img src="photo/10.png" width="800"><br><br>

### RPM <a name="rpm"></a>

You can set a limitation of ERPM of the motor, if you command a ERPM over this amount, the motor driver will only call the limited amount in stead of the amount you command.

<img src="photo/12.png" width="800"><br><br>

### PID control setting <a name="pid"></a>

A proportional‚Äìintegral‚Äìderivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value ùëí(ùë°) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.

Proportional (P) control: This component adjusts the output of the process based on the current error between the setpoint and the process variable (PV). The larger the error, the larger the correction applied.

<img src="photo/PID_P.png" width="150"><br>

Integral (I) control: This component adjusts the output based on the accumulated error over time. It helps eliminate steady-state error and can improve the stability of the control system.

<img src="photo/PID_I.png" width="180"><br>

Derivative (D) control: This component adjusts the output based on the rate of change of the error. It helps to dampen oscillations and improve the stability of the control system but is often omitted because PI control is sufficient. The derivative term can amplify measurement noise (random fluctuations) and cause excessive output changes. Filters are important to get a better estimate of the process variable rate of change.

<img src="photo/PID_D.png" width="250"><br>

So, all together the output will be:

<img src="photo/PID_PID.png" width="350"><br>

For example, there is the difference between before and after PID controller tuned.

Before:

After:

#### PID controller tuning

In VESC, there is a place that you can tune the PID controller of your motor. On the left hand side of the window, there is a tab called "PID controllers".

1. RPM PID contorl - when you are using ERPM value to control the motor, you need to adjust the speed kp, ki and kd in order to optimize the performance.
2. Minimum ERPM - VESC will ignore all the ERPM control command under this value
3. Ramp ERPM per second - acceleration of your motor
4. Position PID control - when you are control your motor to turn to specific angle, you need to adjust the position kp, ki and kd in order to optimize the performance.
5. Position Angle Division - Angle division for the position controller. Can be used to map one control rotation to several motor rotations. For example: M3058 motor has a gear ratio about 19.203
6. Angle off-set - Angle offset for the position controller.

<img src="photo/PID_control.png" width="1200"><br><br>

## Fault / Error <a name="error"></a>

if the light color of the VESC turned from green to red, that means that there is something error in the process of running the motor. In order to watch the fault or error, you can go to VESC to check the problem. (if you are connecting the VESC, you can find that a warning which show the name of the error will pop up on the right-bottom of the window)

<img src="photo/fault0.png" width="800"><br><br>
<img src="photo/print_fault1.png" width="800"><br><br>

if you want to find out the details of the error, there is a tab which called "Print Faults" in the "Terminal" tab. by clicking this, you can find out the details of the error. 

For example, "FAULT_CODE_ABS_OVER_CURRENT" existed, it means that when you were controlling the motor, there was a over-current and the VESC cut the current immediately. To solve the problem, you may need to either set a higher value of max absolute current limiation or stop the e-stop function and report only in the VESC (not recommended).

## Can bus communication <a name="can"></a>

Control Area Network (CAN) bus is a serial communication protocol that allows devices to exchange data in a reliable and efficient way. It is widely used in vehicles, working like a nervous system to connect ECUs in the vehicle.

In contrast to conventional networks like USB or Ethernet, CAN operates differently by not transmitting large blocks of data point-to-point from node A to node B under the control of a central bus master. Instead, in a CAN network, brief messages are broadcasted to the entire network, ensuring uniform data consistency across every node within the system.

<img src="photo/Can_bus_01.png" width="800"><br><br>

In this sample, we will use Nucleo F446RE which one of the MCU board from STM32 to connect to our VESC and control them by sending command through CAN bus channel.<br><br>
Because of the can bus function in the mbed library which we will use in our MCU has bugs, the can bus channel will be reseted when the forth message sent and this message will be disappear within teh can bus channel.<br><br>
So we can't use the can bus channel in the our MCU, we nned to use SPI channel to send the message to MCP2515 and use it to send the message thrugh Can bus channel to our VESC.

### Can bus setting (MCU connect to VESC)

<img src="photo/Can_setting01.JPEG" width="800"><br><br>

## STM32 borad coding <a name="stm32"></a>

To use STM32 MCU board to control the VESC through Can bus channel, you need to download the library and put them into your project (path: [VESC_resourse](https://github.com/JordanLaw/robocon/tree/c1c75149bda7144bffbc41a051190d7ec50529c1/vesc/VESC_stm32_resourse/library)).

<img src="photo/vesc_lib.png" width="1300"><br><br>

Then, you can copy and upload the sample code below into the STM32 board, and try to command the motor using STM32 board.<br>
The sample code will send a command to VESC and control the motor spin 90 degrees when you press the blue button.

```c
#include "mbed.h"
#include "CAN3.h"
#include "vesc.h"

#define CAN_MSG_ID_1  0x111
#define CAN_MSG_ID_2  0x222

#define CAN_MSG_DATA_1  ""
#define CAN_MSG_DATA_2  "CAN message 2"

// 1 -> f446re, 0 -> f446ZE
#define BOARD 1

#if BOARD == 1
    SPI spi(PA_7, PA_6, PA_5);
    CAN can2(PA_11, PA_12, 1000000);  //rd, td, hz
    CAN3 can(spi, PA_4);

    DigitalOut home1(PC_12);
    DigitalOut home2(PC_11);

#else
    SPI spi(PA_7, PA_6, PA_5);
    CAN can2(PA_11, PA_12, 1000000);  //rd, td, hz
    CAN3 can(spi, PB_6);

#endif

DigitalIn userbutton(PC_13);
vesc dir46(46, &can, 1000000, Motor_type::m3508);

int main(){
   can.frequency(CAN_1MBPS_8MHZ);

   while(1){
        if (!userbutton){
            dir46.comm_can_set_pos(90);
        }
        else{
            dir46.comm_can_set_pos(0);
        }

        wait_us(10);
   }

}

```
